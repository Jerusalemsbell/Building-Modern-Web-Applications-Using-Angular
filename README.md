This is the code repository for [Building Modern Web Application using Angular](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angular-ui-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781785880728), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Angular is an modern web application development framework. With Angular you could develop web apps using different flavors of JavaScript such as ES5 (the current version of JavaScript), ES6/ES2015 (upcoming version of JavaScript or TypeScript (typed superset of JavaScript) or any language that can be compiled into JavaScript. Its component-based architecture makes life easy for developers to build complex UI applications.

This book takes you on a journey from the basics of Angular to creating cutting edge web application with it.

This book starts with basic of Angular 2 and brushing you up with the new features of Angular 4. It shows you how to build an end-to-end conference management application using the individual Angular 2 and Angular 4 features explained in previous chapters. Along with covering framework, it will also explain how to structure complex applications and give you some best practices to follow. Towards the end of the book you'll learn how to build one end-to-end application by with eh knowledge gained from the previous chapters by implementing, testing, and deploying the app. Finally the book explains how to use third-party frameworks based on both Angular 2 and Angular 4.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter1

The code will look like the following:
       
       static int ngpios;
       static int gpios[2] = { -1 , -1 };
       module_param_array(gpios, int, &ngpios, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP);
       MODULE_PARM_DESC(gpios, "Defines the GPIOs number to be used as a list of"
                        " numbers separated by commas.");

       /* Logging stuff */
       #define __message(level, fmt, args...)                                  \
                       printk(level "%s: " fmt "\n" , NAME , ## args)
